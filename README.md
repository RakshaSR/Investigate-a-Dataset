# Investigate-a-Dataset
Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree August 2020

# Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

# What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

## Step One - Choose Your Data Set
Choose the data set , here i choose tmbd- movies data set.

## Step Two - Get Organized
Create a single folder (repositories) that contains:

The report communicating your findings
Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis
The data set you used

## Step Three - Analyze Your Data
Make questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. I aimed to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in my investigation. Make sure I use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

## Step Four - Share Your Findings
Create a report that shares the findings I found most interesting.
